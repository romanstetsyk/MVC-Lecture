# MVC Architectural pattern

## What is MVC?

Over the years websites have changed from simple static documents to complex applications with hundreds of developers working on them. As the application grows in size it is essential to organize the codebase in a way to make it easy to work with. That's why developers created different architectures to structure their applications, the so called "skeletons" on which they are built, that define how different components, interfaces, databases, etc. interact with one another.

MVC is a popular software pattern used to break up the logic of an application into three different components:

- **M**odel
- **V**iew
- **C**ontroller
